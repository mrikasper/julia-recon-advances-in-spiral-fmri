Example undersampled spiral image reconstruction with static B0 correction using [MRIReco.jl](https://magneticresonanceimaging.github.io/MRIReco.jl/latest/) for data published with Paper "Advances in Spiral fMRI"

This repository showcases an interative image reconstruction (conjugate gradient SENSE) of undersampled high-resolution single-shot spiral fMRI data, including accelerated static B0 correction using a pre-acquired and -processed B0 and sensitivity map. The data for this example is publicly available on [ETH Research Collection](dx.doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000487412)
